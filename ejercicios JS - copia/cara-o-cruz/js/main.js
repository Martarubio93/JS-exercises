// There are N coins, each showing either heads or tails. We would like all the coins to form a sequence of alternating heads and tails. What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed to achieve this?
// that, given array A consisting of N integers represententing the coin, returns the minimum number of coins that must be reversed. Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive coins and contain either a 0 (heads) or a 1 (tails).
